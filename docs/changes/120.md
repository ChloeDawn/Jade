# 1.20 Upgrading Guide

## GuiGraphics

Rendering methods that used to receive a `PoseStack` now receive a `GuiGraphics` instead, to follow the changes made by Mojang in 1.20.

## IServerDataProvider

`IServerDataProvider` now takes a `BlockAccessor` / `EntityAccessor` in the type parameter instead of a `BlockEntity` or `Entity`. The corresponding method signature has also been simplified.
